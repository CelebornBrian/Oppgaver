# Oppgaver
Tasks for my course IMT-1031 Basic Programming and the following course IMT-2082 - Object oriented Programming.
Also begun standardisation of naming standard for tasks.
All tasks from the PDF named "gprog.pdf" or "ooprog.pdf" will be named in the format "Oppgavexx.cpp", with a dash for additional information as needed. 
All tasks from the course book, "Object-Oriented Programming in C++" Fourth Edition by Robert Lafore will be named "Boka - Kapittelxx - Oppgavexx.cpp"
Datafiles will start with DAT followed by the same used in the task they belong to.
